    <h1>Festive</h1>
    <p> A festive dress code is relatively new in the wedding space, so many invitees will be left scratching their heads. To break it down, festive wedding attire gives you the autonomy to play around with your look and have fun doing so. Following the proper attire guidelines, women are encouraged to wear cocktail party attire that features bolder colors, playful accessories, and unique silhouettes. Men should sport a patterned or textured suit, jazzed up with a bright tie or creative pocket square.</p>
